# Soft-Clipping-Swish-activation-function
A novel activation function in Computer Vision and NLP

This repository is based on my proposal called Soft-Clipping Swish: A Novel Activation Function for Deep Learning paper, where I introduced a novel function inspired by ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Swish, Soft Clipping functions. 

If you're using the code please refer with the following citation:
"Marina-Adriana Mercioni et al., Soft-Clipping Swish: A Novel Activation Function for Deep Learning, May 2021, DOI: 10.1109/SACI51354.2021.9465622, Conference: 2021 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI)".

Thank you!
